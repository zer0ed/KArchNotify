v1.2
~~~~
- Now more active KDE dialogs, a prompt asking to display a list of updates
- Oldschool mode for those who like the old passive popup mode.
- No dialogs unless there are updates available (silent)
- User config file moved to /etc/karchnotify.conf  (common practice)
- KDE startup script changed from a script to a KDE desktop file  (common practice)
